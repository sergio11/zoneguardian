### 📋 Detailed Parameter Descriptions

1. **🌐 `--domains` (Required)**  
   Specifies the domains to be scanned.  
   - Example: `--domains example.com,example2.com`  
   - **Note**: Separate domains with commas, without spaces.

2. **⚡ `--threads`**  
   Sets the number of threads for parallel processing.  
   - Default: `10`  
   - A higher value speeds up the scan for multiple domains but may increase CPU usage.  
   - Example: `--threads 20`  

3. **📄 `--output-json`**  
   Defines the file path for saving detailed JSON results.  
   - Default: `zoneguardian_results.json`  
   - Includes all analyzed DNS records and WHOIS data.  
   - Example: `--output-json results/my_results.json`  

4. **📊 `--output-pdf`**  
   Defines the file path for saving the final PDF report.  
   - Default: `zoneguardian_report.pdf`  
   - Contains an executive summary, vulnerability classification, and recommendations.  
   - Example: `--output-pdf reports/my_report.pdf`  

### ✅ Usage Example

To scan two domains (`example.com` and `test.com`), using 15 threads, and save results in custom files:  

```bash
python zoneguardian.py --domains example.com,test.com --threads 15 --output-json results.json --output-pdf report.pdf
```

### 📌 Notes
Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the script.
* The --domains parameter is mandatory; the script will not execute without it.
* Customize the output paths to prevent overwriting existing files.
