    This class is designed to analyze DNS vulnerability data, leveraging AI models and other tools to provide actionable insights into potential security risks.
    
    It uses a Groq AI model for detailed analysis and HuggingFace embeddings for vector-based search. The class integrates with Langchain for effective document retrieval and information extraction from DNS scan results.

    Attributes:
        model (ChatGroq): Groq AI model used for processing the DNS vulnerability scan data.
        embeddings (HuggingFaceEmbeddings): Embedding model from HuggingFace used to convert text data into vector representations.
